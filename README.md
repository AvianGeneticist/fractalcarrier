This is a Naev plugin that adds "subcarriers"; that is, carriers that can be held in bays, that release their own carries in combat.

**Ships**

The Za'lek Subcarrier Drone comes in either a pair (medium bay slot) or a quartet (large bay slot). Each Subcarrier has:
- A 130 second rebuild time.
- 220 Shield (16 Regen) and 60 Armour.
- A modified Electron Burst Cannon for long-ranged support.
- A miniaturized Point Defense turret for fending off missiles.
- And a Za'lek Drone Micro Bay, which manages a pair of Za'lek Light Drones; these behave like mini- or full bays; 60 second repawn time, lightning quick deploy speed, and so on.

If you're using my [Big Largeness](https://github.com/AvianGeneticist/biglargeness) plugin, install the [Big Fractals patch](https://github.com/AvianGeneticist/aabigfractals); it solves some tech list conflicts between the two plugins and adds a mega bay for the subcarriers.
