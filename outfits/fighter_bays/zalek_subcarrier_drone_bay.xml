  <description>This bay operates a quartet of subcarrier drones, which can each manage a pair of Za'lek light drones, contributing significant swarming potential to the fleet. However, the drones take a substantial amount of time to fabricate, and they're quite heavy. The entire system also takes a considerable amount of computational power, and the drones require a substantial amount of fabrication time. It comes with all the devices required for the maintenance and flight of the drones.</description>
